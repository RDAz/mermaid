# Mermaid

## What is mermaid?

Over the past few years, we perceived a big advance in the tools we use to create documentation and what they can do. From plain text with simple formating, to extensive multi-linked online auto-generated documentation, able to organize information in an appealing way. These new tools where developed to speed-up and facilitate this process, Well, [Mermaid](http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/#mermaid) is one of such tools. Mermaid is a tool used for the creation of diagrams in a simple way. Using a simple *markdown*-like script language for generating diagrams from 3 diferent classes of diagrams:

* Flowcharts ([Syntax](http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/#flowcharts-basic-syntax))
* Sequence Diagrams ([Syntax](http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/#sequence-diagrams))
* Gantt Diagrams ([Syntax](http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/#gant-diagrams))

Built with software developers in mind, presenting itself as an light diagram creation tool, that works convetring directly from text to a graphical diagram, it's simple syntax and configurable presentation, from the direction the diagram has, to styling each individual component, Mermaid ultimately can be describe as a javascript based simple-to-use syntax()-to-diagram creator. 

Wanna try it? Here's a [live editor](http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/live_editor/) for you :)

## How does it work?

This is what we set out to find: what components has mermaid? What do they do? How do they interact with each other? How do they comunicate? What does each individual component do?

Well, we present to you our answear as a 4 + 1 view model. Next we will describe the __logical__, __development__, __process__ and __phisical__ view of Mermaid.

Lastly, a real-world scenario will be presented.


### Process view
The process view deals with the dynamic aspects of the system, explains the system processes and how they communicate, and focuses on the runtime behavior of the system. The process view addresses concurrency, distribution, integrators, performance, and scalability, among other. UML Diagrams to represent process view include the Activity diagram.

An activity diagrams is a graphical representations of workflows of stepwise activities and actions with support for choice, iteration and concurrency. In the UML, activity diagrams are intended to model both computational and organizational processes (i.e. workflows). Next follows a activity diagram for the Mermaid project.

### Logical view

This view describes the functionality that the system provides to end-users. It indicates what the system should be able to do,presenting it's limitations and describing generally what each component does. Logical views generally contains a class diagram, an activity diagram and a state Diagram.

As the name indicates, the class diagram describes each class of the project, and answears some basic questions like: witch methods does each class offer? , witch variables does it hold?,  witch dependencies exist between classes?, among others.
3  class diagrams are presented next to get a better picture of the logial view. Each class diagram corresponds to the specified diagram type:

### Development view

The development view illustrates a system from a programmer's perspective and it describes the architecture that supports the software development process. This view focuses on configuration management and actual software module organization in the development environment. While the Logical View is at the conceptual level, the diagrams in this view represent the physical-level artifacts that are built by the team. This view normally contains what is know by a component diagram

A component diagram describes the organization and wiring of the physical components in a system. Component diagrams are often drawn to help model implementation details and double-check that every aspect of the system's required functions is covered by planned development. A component diagram is presented next. Since all of the diagrams have the same components, we will only present one component diagram.

### Physical view

The physical view depicts the system from a system engineer's point of view. It is concerned with the topology of software components on the physical layer, as well as the physical connections between these components. This view is also known as the deployment view. This view usually contains a Deployment diagram.

The deployment diagram models the physical deployment of artifacts on nodes. To describe a web site, for example, a deployment diagram would show what hardware components exist, what software components run on each node, and how the different pieces are connected. Sadly, we weren't able to analise mermaid on this level, due to the complexity off layers of software involved when mermaid is running on a server, so no deployment diagram will  be shown.

The Physical view also encompasses some other concerns, like how to get the program up and running in your local machine, or on a server, if possible. Here's a brief description on how to do this:
There are three ways to use mermaid:

*  installing mermaid on your computer:
*  on a website that has mermaid installed or
*  adding to browserify


For detailed instructions on how to install and run mermaid on your computer/server/website, please refer to : [Instalation](http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/#installation)


### Scenario

Lastly we want to present a real-world scenario: the mermaid [live editor](http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/live_editor/). 
Unfortunently we weren't able analise all the layers of software that compose the server version of mermaid. The following diagram describes the process of using the mermaid live editor:

![Scenario](http://s33.postimg.org/tuq40773j/Deployment_diagram.jpg)

The process involved is rather simple:

	We have a split screen, text as the input and an image as an output.The computer/server will read your input in real time and send you feedback:
    	1. On the first line you type what kind of diagram you want
        2. Start typing the nodes,connections and configurations you desira, and as you type, if you are doing it right, the chart will appear on the right side. 
        3. If you want you can share it or download / save it.


### In short

So, after all the views, we conclude that mermaid work in a rather simple way:

* When  installed locally, it receives as inout a text file, witch then is handed to the parser, witch creates a strutcture with all the data and delivers it to the database, that then stores all the values, taht are different for each type of diagram. Then the drawind component acesses the database and retrieves this data and draws the corretct graph

* When running on a server, Mermaid does the same thing, but has the capability of live editing, this is, the editions typed on the text document appear in-real-time on screen.
